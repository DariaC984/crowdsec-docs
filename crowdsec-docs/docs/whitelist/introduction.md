Whitelists are special parsers that allow you to "discard" events, and can exist at two different steps:

 - *Parser whitelists*: Allow you to discard an event at parse time, so that it never hits the buckets.
 - *PostOverflow whitelists*: Those are whitelists that are checked *after* the overflow happens. It is usually best for whitelisting processes that can be expensive (such as performing reverse DNS on an IP or performing a `whois` of an IP).

:::info

While the whitelists are the same for parser or postoverflows, beware that field names might change.

Source IP is usually in `evt.Meta.source_ip` when it's a log, but `evt.Overflow.Source_ip` when it's an overflow

:::

The whitelist can be based on several criteria:

 - specific ip address: if the event/overflow IP is the same, event is whitelisted
 - ip ranges: if the event/overflow IP belongs to this range, event is whitelisted
 - a list of [expr](https://github.com/antonmedv/expr) expressions: if any expression returns true, event is whitelisted
